I am Zhe Su (苏哲), a master student from Master of Science in Machine Learning in CMU. I did my undergraduate study in Mixed Class, Chu Kochen Honors College, Zhejiang University. I am broadly interested in speech synthesizing, natural language processing, and machine learning.

I was a research intern at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), working with principal researcher [Li Dong](http://dong.li/). I also worked with [Zhou Zhao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhaozhou) at Zhejiang University on text-to-speech. I spent the spring of 2022 working with [Zhenbang Wu](https://zzachw.github.io/), Dr. [Huaxiu Yao](https://huaxiuyao.mystrikingly.com/) and Prof. [Jimeng Sun](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/jimeng) on knowledge-driven drug recommendation.
